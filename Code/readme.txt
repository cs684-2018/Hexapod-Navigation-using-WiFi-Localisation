Archrobotic's Hexy : Open Source Low Cost Arduino DIY Hexapood Kit 
 
 
Project Description 
------------------- 
The objective of this project is to implement an efficient and reliable WiFi
RSSI based localization system and use it to navigate the hexapod in designated area.
Previous implementations have shown that RSSI could give accuracy up to 10 cm in 2m√ó2m
area. This decides the size of test area.
